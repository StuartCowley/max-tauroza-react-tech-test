## Description

A React web application that allows users to search for images.

## Tech that was used

- React
- Axios

## Dependencies

Jest, React, React Testing Library and Axios

## How to install and run the app

- Fork and clone this repository
- Open the cloned directory and run `npm install`

## How to use it

Use the script `npm start` to run the app in development mode. Enter a search term into the search input and click submit or hit enter to search. If it is a valid search term, the search results will be returned in a gallery below the search input, otherwise you will be invited to try searching for something else.
To run the tests, use the command `npm test`.

## What's missing?

Given some more time I would spend more time on styling to make the mobile user experience better (ensuring the search button size stays large enough with smaller screens), and more styling for the image gallery/search results to make it more visually appealing. I would also add a click to inspect function to allow users to click on an image to enlarge it fully.

## Credits

I used the create-react-app npx script to set up the basic scaffolding of the project; the Command Shift track helped me along the way.
